      <description>My name is Arturo Ramos Viedas, and I wrote this blog post as part of an assignment for my TC2007B course.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to talk about the history of software, and about software and programming in general, without at least touching on the subject of testing. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to think about coding even a very simple program without including some sort of test in the process. This has been the case for a long time, probably for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code.</description>

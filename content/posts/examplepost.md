It's hard to talk about the history of software, and about software and programming in general, without at least touching on the subject of testing. In fact, it's hard for me to think about coding even a very simple program without including some sort of test in the process. This has been the case for a long time, probably for as long as I've been writing code. From making sure that my scripts would not cause my asset-flipped ROBLOX game to implode, to stressing over the several cases my professors could use to break my program after I turn it in. Obviously, in these cases, the stakes are much lower than they would be for a piece of software intended for commercial use. While not testing my code could lead to me getting a low grade on an assignment, the developers of a program meant to provide an important service or store the sensitive data of its users can't afford the luxury of shipping an untested, or not properly tested, product.
